# SmithyDAO / CastleDAO integration

![](/smithy-dao/partnership.png)

Today we are announcing a partnership with SmithyDAO's Smithonia ecosystem.

Smithonia Weapons aim to be the interoperable crafting layer of the metaverse
and we will be integrating their weapons into the CastleDAO battle system.

If you are an owner of a Smithonia Weapon, you will be able to use it in your deck of cards in CastleDAO! 


## How it will work?

When you are configuring your deck in CastleDAO, you will be able to see your smithonia weapons and attach them to your warriors.

Each weapon will include boosts for certain races/classes of warriors in the game. Additionally to this, every time you level up your items in SmithyDAO quests they will become more powerful in the CastleDAO battles.
