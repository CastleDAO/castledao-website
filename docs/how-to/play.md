## Getting started
Welcome to CastleDAO, General! In this game, your goal is to protect your land and battle against enemies using NFTs (non-fungible tokens). These tokens represent powerful warriors, each with their own unique art, abilities, and attributes. You can find a variety of NFT collections in the blacksmith, including Castles, Generals, DefiHeroes, and SmolBrawlers. Some of these collections can be minted for free, while others require ETH.

To train your warriors and improve their attributes, visit the "Training" section of the map. Here, you can send your Generals and DefiHeroes on quests to gain experience, which can be used to level up their stats.

To participate in battles, you'll need to create a deck using a combination of NFTs from the various collections available. There are three game modes to choose from: Classic, Modern, and Tower. Classic mode requires a Castle and a General, while Modern mode allows for any combination of NFTs or demo warriors. To create your deck, select the required number of warriors from the available collections, taking into consideration their attributes and abilities.

Warriors have the following attributes: Constitution (health points), Strength (physical damage), Agility (probability to dodge and critical hit), Defense (damage reduction), Ability Power (modifier for abilities), Speed (order of attack), Magic Resistance (resistance to abilities), and Intelligence (mana regeneration). You can also equip your warriors with items to boost their stats and abilities. Each warrior has a capacity for a certain number of items, ranging from 20-40, with Castles able to hold up to 250.

Abilities are special attacks or effects that can be used at the beginning of each turn. Each warrior can use one ability per turn, and their mana is reset to 0 afterwards. Some abilities include blind (disables attack and dodge for 2 turns), freeze (disables attack, dodge, mana generation, and spell casting for 1 turn), energyWave (deals magic damage to all enemies), encourage (increases Strength for 3 turns), fast (increases Speed for 3 turns), weaken (reduces defense for 2 turns), slow (reduces speed for 2 turns), magic (increases Intelligence for 3 turns), and more.

To initiate a battle, visit the "Battles" section of the map and choose your opponent. You'll be able to see your opponent's deck and strategize your moves based on their warriors' attributes and abilities. The battle will be resolved based on the stats and abilities of each warrior, with the victor being determined by the surviving side.

We hope this guide helps you on your journey as a General in CastleDAO. Good luck in your battles!






## Guide 
The map

![](https://i.imgur.com/DMvFloD.png)

Generals in CastleDAO need some NFTs to fight against each other and determine who is the bravest of all. 

Luckily, in the [blacksmith](/blacksmith) there are some Free Mints that you can have to get started, or remember, you can also invoke many of our integrated collections.

## The Blacksmith

In the blacksmith you will find our different collections:
- Castles
- Generals
- DefiHeroes
- SmolBrawlers

All of our collections have interesting powers and abilities that are relevant to the CastleDAO game. 

All of them have unique artworks, strength, speed, abilities and other attributes that we will see later on.

In the blacksmith you can invoke our collections, some of them are free to mint and others cost some ETH. 



## Training

Generals and DefiHeroes have some attributes that live on-chain, meaning that their power stays with them forever. 

You can level up your Generals and DefiHeroes on the "Training" section of the map.

Each of these warriors can go on a quest every 24 hours, and then use the experience to level up all their attributes by one.


## How to create a deck?

If you want to start battling, you will need to create a deck. Decks hold your warriors and determine your fighting strategy. 

Visit the "My Decks" section and choose one of the gaming modes.

- Classic
- Modern
- Tower

Each game mode requires a different combination of cards. To play **Classic** you will need to own a **Castle** and a **General**. But in **Modern** you can play with any combination of NFTs or **Demo Warriors**.

To create your deck, select the required number of Warriors (NFTs) from any of the different collections integrated in CastleDAO.

Each collection and warrior have different _Attributes_. Those attributes are determined by each collection, rarity and other factors decided during the integration of the collection.




## What are the different warrior attributes?

The following is a explanation of what each attribute means: 

- Constitution: Indicates the health points of the warrior (multiplied by 20)
- Strength: Physical damage of the warrior
- Agility: Probability to dodge and probability of critical hit
- Defense: Block Damage based on a 100% probability
- Ability Power: Increases modifiers of abilities by a percentage
- Speed: Speed determines the order of attack, faster warriors attack first
- Magic Resistance: Diminishes Effects of abilities by percentage
- Intelligence: Increases mana regeneration. Spells are cast at 10 mana.

To boost your warriors you can add items to each of them by clicking on "Manage Items":

Each warrior has a capacity (amount of slots for items) that varies between 20-40. Castles have additional capacity, up to 250.

Items will give your warriors additional boosts and abilities.

Click on "Start combat" and see the execution of the combat.

Right now CastleDAO only supports automattic combats, where the fate of the winner is decided by the attributes of the warriors, items and abilities.

Each battle have different turns and each turn is divided into different phases:

### Clear effects

Removes effects from cards, such as poison, fire, etc, that have expired.

### Add mana

Each warrior adds mana based on their Intelligence

#### Cast Spells

- Each warrior casts spells if their mana reached 10 points. The order of the casting is determined by the speed of the warrior.
- A warrior's ability increases the effect of the spell.

- A warrior magic resistance decreases the effect of direct damage spells received

### Attack:

- Each warrior that is capable of attacking, will perform an attack on a random enemy. The order of the attacks is determined by the speed of the warrior.
- An attack can be dodged if the agility of the enemy is high.
- An attack can be critical if the agility of the attacker is high.
- Some warriors will have passive abilities like Double Attack or Life Steal that can alter the number of the attacks or the effects produced.
  Every time a warrior takes a hit, it will increase the amount of mana they have.
- A warrior dies when their life reaches 0. Their total life is determined by its constitution.
- A high defense will block damage from attacks.


## Rewards!


The ruby system in CastleDAO works as a way to participate in battles and win rewards. Here's a quick guide on how it works:

1. Claim your daily ruby allowance by visiting the bank and interacting with the goblin banker. You can claim 50 ruby every day.
2. Go to the arena and choose a battle mode (Classic, Modern, or Tower). 
3. Submit 10 ruby to the gates of the arena to challenge another player. This will cost you 10 ruby, but if you win the battle you will earn 20 ruby back as a reward. If you lose, you will lose your 10 ruby and the challenged player will earn an additional 5 ruby.
4. Spend your ruby to unlock new warriors and add them to your deck. These warriors can be found in the "FREE Warriors" section of the deck manager, and unlocking them will allow you to use them in your battles.
5. Keep battling and winning to earn more ruby and climb the leaderboard. The leaderboard ranks players based on their accumulated fight points, which are called SAGA (for Modern battles), LEGEND (for Classic battles), and EPIC (for Tower battles).
