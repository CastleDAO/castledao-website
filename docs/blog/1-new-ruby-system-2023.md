title: New Ruby System for 2023
---
# Welcome 2023

The year 2022 is coming to an end and with it, new changes arrive!

Starting on January 2023 the new leaderboard and ruby system.
Note: this is a test concept that we will be iterating until it creates a sustainable model for players. 

*New Ruby System*

Every day you will be able to claim 50 RUBY by visiting the **Bank** of CastleDAO.
You will need to submit **10 RUBY** to the gates of the arena to challenge other players. As a reward you will earn **20 Ruby** back if you win, if you are defeated you will lose your **10 RUBY** and **5 RUBY** will be sent to the challenged player.

*New leaderboard system*

Players in the leaderboard will not be ranked by RUBY, instead they will accumulate fight points through each victory. Those points are called:
- SAGA for Modern
- LEGEND for Classic
- EPIC for Tower

Each time you win a battle on Modern and Classic you will earn 1 Battle point ( SAGA or LEGEND ). 
The tower points will continue to operate like until now. They are less relevant since there's only 1 top player. 

*Using RUBY*

Players will be able to spend RUBY to unlock new warriors that will be added to the "FREE Warriors" area in the deck manager. Unlocking a warrior will allow to use it in your deck.

We will explore how these new features turn out and wait to hear your feedback. 

Have a happy new year!
